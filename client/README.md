## Getting Started

A live demo of the project can be found [here](https://chrisdruke-bookstore.onrender.com).

If you'd like to host the project yourself, clone the repo and within the root of the project run `npm run start` command to host the localized API server (probably at `localhost:3000`). Then navigate into `/client` and run `npm run dev` to host the bookstore frontend locally.

To login to the application, you can use either of the following credentials:

```
username: harry
password: potter
```

```
username: hermione
password: granger
```
